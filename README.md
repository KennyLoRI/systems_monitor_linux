# CppND-System-Monitor
![System Monitor](images/monitor.png)

In this project I built an Open Systems Monitor using C++. Initial starter code was provided by Udacity as the projet was part of a C++ course.


## Make
This project uses [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The Makefile has four targets:
* `build` compiles the source code and generates an executable
* `format` applies [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to style the source code
* `debug` compiles the source code and generates an executable, including debugging symbols
* `clean` deletes the `build/` directory, including all of the build artifacts

## Credits 
Most of my work was done to read and extract the data in the linux_parser.cpp file. The general software architecture was already provided. The actual front-end has been provided as well as part of the Udacity C++ Nanodegree program.
